### Running the Program

Main class: 
- GameMain

Data files needed: 
- all gifs in resources folder

Key/Mouse inputs: 
- Click to Pause
- Move Paddle with left and right keys

Cheat keys:
- powerups: 
- s - split
- p - powershot (aimed)  (space to fire)
- b - BIG paddle
- l - laser  (space to fire)

Known Bugs:

Extra credit:
- customization, but I didn't even get to finish, 
and I wanted to make paddles on all four walls, but nowhere near
enough time


### Notes
Spent a lot of time refactoring, probably more than implementing
features.
