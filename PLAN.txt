Plan for Game Project

I enjoyed the Circus variant of Breakout. I loved the idea of launching flailing acrobats into the air with a
seesaw-like catapult as opposed to using a paddle to rebound a ball. I also thought it was cool that you have
to strategically land a person to launch the other person high enough; otherwise, gravity prevents them from even
reaching the "blocks". I enjoyed the low-level animation too.



My Project
Title: Block Breaker

Inspiration: The original Breakout and one of its descendants - Brick Breaker (I loved to play this
on my Dad's Blackberry).

General Idea: Paddles on all 4 sides of the screen. The up and down arrow keys will control the left and
right paddles; the left and right arrow keys the top and bottom paddles.


Powerups (there will be multiple random powerups a level, placed in random blocks, and they'll fall towards
whichever side of a block was hit e.g. could fall up towards the op paddle):
* laser guns on paddles for 3 seconds
* ball splits into 4 balls
* bigger paddles for 10 seconds
* supercharge - next time the ball lands on your paddle, the ball stops, then you can aim and fire a ball
that will go through 5 hits worth of blocks OR break a metal/trampoline/sand block

Cheats: 
* fast forward - speeds up the ball's velocity, paddles unaffected
* slow mo - slow's the ball down, paddles unaffected
* HUGE paddles - paddles take up the whole wall
* revive - one extra life
* next level
* previous level

Status:
* current level
* current score
* lives remaining
* current powerup name/"normal"

Block Types:
* gamma block (g) - the hardest block to destroy (3 hits)
* beta block (b) - the second hardest block to destroy (2 hits)
* alpha block (a) - the easiest block to destroy (1 hit)
* metal block (m) - can't be destroyed
* sand block (q) - like metal block, except ball decelerates on rebound
* trampoline block (t) - like metal block, except ball accelerates on rebound

Extra feature:
I'm not sure if having paddles on all walls is the extra feature or if that's simply what makes my version a
variant of Breakout, so I'll create a "Customize" feature, which will present an interface that the user can
use to change the coloring of their ball or select from multiple game backgrounds. This feature gives the
user the freedom to craft their visual experience to their liking.

Level 1 setup:
basic rectangular mass with weaker blocks on outside

Level 3 setup:
trampoline and sand blocks on inside, making these interesting
outer layer of alpha blocks - easy to destroy, hard to paddle the rebound because of proximity to wall
